# mastodon-install
Mastodon Installer for Ubuntu 20.04

# This script includes the following options:

-v or --version: Specifies the version of Mastodon to install. The default value is "stable".
-d or --no-deps: Skips the installation of dependencies. The default value is true, which means that the dependencies will be installed.

# To use these options, pass them as command line arguments when running the script. For example, to install the "testing" version of Mastodon without installing the dependencies, you would run the script like this:

* ./install.sh -v testing -d


# Please note that this script is intended for use on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04, and may not work on other operating systems or versions of Ubuntu.

Also, please make sure to read the documentation for Mastodon and follow any additional steps that may be necessary for setting up and configuring the software.
